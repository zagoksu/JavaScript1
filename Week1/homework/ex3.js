// Exercise 3: Log the number

// First, declare your variable numberX. Do not initialize it (which means, don't give it a value) yet.

let numberX;

// Add a console.log statement that explains in words what you think the value of x is, like in this example.

console.log("it should be undefined because i didn't assigned a value to it.");

// Add a console.log statement that logs the value of numberX.

console.log(numberX);

// Now initialize your variable numberX with a number (also called an integer in computer science terms).

numberX = 7;

// Next, add a console.log statement that explains what you think the value of numberX is.

console.log("it should be 7 because it has been assigned value 0f 7.");

// Add a console.log statement that logs the value of numberX. */

console.log(numberX);
