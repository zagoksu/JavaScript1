// Exercise 4: Log the string

// Declare a variable myString and assign a string to it. Use your full name, including spaces, as the content for the string.

let myString = "Zeynel Abidin Göksu";

// Write a console.log statement in which you explain in words what you think the value of the string is.

console.log("the value of the string should be 'Zeynel Abidin Göksu'");

// Now console.log the variable myString.

console.log(myString);

// Now reassign to the variable myString a new string.

myString = "zagoksu";

// Just like what you did before write a console.log statement that explains in words what you think will be logged to the console.

console.log("the value of the string should be 'zagoksu'");

// Now console.log myString again.

console.log(myString);
