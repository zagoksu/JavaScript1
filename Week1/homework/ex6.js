// Exercise 6: Log an array of animals

// Follow the steps. Make sure that each step is written on the line after.

// Declare variable and assign to it an empty array. Make sure that the name of the variable indicates it contains more than 1 item. For example items instead of item.

let carBrands = [];

// Write a console.log statement that explains in words what you think the value of the array is.

console.log("the value of the array should be [].")

// Write a console.log statement that logs the array.

console.log(carBrands);

// Create a new variable with an array that has 3 of your favorite animals, each in a different string. Make sure the name of the variables says something about what the variable contains.

let myFavAnimals = ["Lion", "Cat", "Eagle" ];

// Write a console.log statement that logs the second array.

console.log(myFavAnimals);

// Add a statement that adds another string ("Piglet)" to the array of animals.

myFavAnimals.push("Piglet");

//Write a console.log statement that logs the second array!

console.log(myFavAnimals);
